HINT: I found this weird old game in my attic. Looks really old, probably a cartridge to some game console. Something seems hidden in the game though.
HINT 2: Do you know how to use the file command on a shell?
HINT 3: You may need help of any emulators you can find. Look for ones accessing tile data.
A .gb file ==> Game Boy cartridge file.

I used [YY-chr](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/119/) to see the sprites (see yychr.png).
