"The mask is not for you, it's to protect the people you care about."

We have a .xcf file. It is used by GIMP (Open-source alternative to Adobe Photoshop basically).

Opening the file in GIMP, we see a QR code with a black layer mask (which hid the QR code)
Remove the layer mask and scan the code.

(I hadn't saved the flag and I'm too lazy to do it all over again, so I won't mention it here. Do it yourself, the file is in the git repo.)
