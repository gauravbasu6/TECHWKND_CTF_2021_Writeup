Hint: My friend is really into Sonic the Hedgehog games, something about the games being really visual or whatever. But recently he has been listening to some weird music. I can't figure out why he likes them so much. Can you?

I opened up the audio file in Audacity and inspected it's Spectrogram results(between 0 and 20,000Hz).
It's a QR Code! (see spectro.png in this folder)

On editing in Photoshop, we get a clear image of the QR code (see QR_code.png)
