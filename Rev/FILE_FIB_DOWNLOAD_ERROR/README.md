Hint: While getting some secret codes, we found an encoder program. However, during the download of the encoder code, we lost CONNEC..................#^$#&^$^#@$^&#@^$&^$#&^ thereby corruptin$&*#$&#() file

the flag is of *&$##$($#)(@$)(#_)$ importance

all we know is the output of this code TFDJZPVQ{SÃŁǘʖПځ੉Ⴉ᪞⫲䕽灐땑𒕆𝪐𯾅񍦣} it seems encoded.

use your smarts to figure out how to decode it
----------------------------------

We know, the flag format is TECHWKND and the ciphertext starts with TFDJZPVQ. On inspection, I realised it is a shift cipher with the shift value increasing acc to the Fibonacci series!
So, just as the question says, use your "smarts" and modify the python code.

For reference, you can see the O/G code in encoder.py and my solution in encoder_modified.py
