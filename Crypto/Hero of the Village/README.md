Steve has been exploiting villagers for months and became extremely rich. A villager enters Steve's fine mansion, which is built with the finest emerald blocks. Then they enter one of the finest rooms and notice an ender chest. They begin to wonder what Steve possibly could have stored in it. But to have a peek inside Steve's ender chest, the villager needs Steve's super-secret password known only to him. Fortunately, the villager finds a fine book and a fine quill right beside the chest with the text duhylhgvu_gk_huip scribbled on it. You realize Steve must have used a fine cipher to encrypt his password and the text in the book is the ciphertext. Help the villager find out what's inside Steve's ender chest.

Decoding the ciphertext we get,
